I loved this builder set as a kid, and now my sons love playing with it.  The parts are very well thought-through in general, but there could always be more parts.

With the advent of 3D printing, now there can be.

# Parts List

## Diagonal 3-Hole bar
The bars in the base set have hole spacing so they can be placed horizontally or vertically.  This bar has holes spaced such that they will attach diagonally to the red blocks.
